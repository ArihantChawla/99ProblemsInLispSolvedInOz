So I was taking a class in Programming Paradigms and as practice I started doing the [99 Problems](https://www.ic.unicamp.br/~meidanis/courses/mc336/2006s2/funcional/L-99_Ninety-Nine_Lisp_Problems.html) in lisp Problem Set in Oz. It's a work in progress and I might never actually complete it depending on how much practice I need for the coursework but I'm linking the [github repository](https://github.com/ArihantChawla/99ProblemsInLispSolvedInOz) here if someone wants to check out and/or work on those problems.
